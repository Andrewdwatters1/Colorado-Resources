We have designed our programs to help those who work hard and have no where else to go for
assistance, as well as those who give back to our communities and country such as public school
teachers, first responders, veterans returning from service abroad and active duty military members.
Our aim is to support those who don’t generally qualify to receive assistance from conventional
agencies so that they don’t find themselves losing everything because of a short-term crisis.
